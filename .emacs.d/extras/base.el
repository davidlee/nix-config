;;; Emacs Bedrock
;;;
;;; Extra config: Base enhancements

;;; Usage: Append or require this file from init.el to enable various UI/UX
;;; enhancements.
;;;
;;; The consult package in particular has a vast number of functions that you
;;; can use as replacements to what Emacs providues by default. Please see the
;;; consult documentation for more information and help:

;;;
;;; In particular, many users may find `consult-line' to be more useful to them
;;; than isearch, so binding this to `C-s' might make sense. This is left to the
;;; user to configure, however, as isearch and consult-line are not equivalent.
