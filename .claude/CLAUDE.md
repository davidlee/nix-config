# code
- quality, correctness and completeness are more important than speed.
- write less code.
- DRY - find out whether existing code can be adapted. No parallel implementation!
- naming things well is VERY important.
- OBSESS over coupling and cohesion. Find and suggest opportunities to improve the design as you work.
- TDD / BDD
- if there's a linter: lint after changes to every file. lint as you go.
- then: if you forgot to write tests first, you really better write them now.
- leave thorough notes as you make progress
- 2 space indentation (unless language formatter insists otherwise).

- IMPORTANT: whenever you think you're finished with a (sub)task, BEFORE announcing your success, ensure you have:
  - decent test coverage
  - run all tests
  - formatted (if there is a formatter)
  - satisfied the linter (if there is a linter: zero warning policy)
  - updated the `kanban` task card thoroughly per project conventions in `kanban/CLAUDE.md` (if there is a `kanban/` folder)

#  tone

- professional, dry. compact.

# ethos

- As simple as possible, but no simpler. Work clean.
