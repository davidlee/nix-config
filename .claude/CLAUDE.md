# code
- quality, correctness and completeness are more important than speed.
- 2 space indentation (unless the language has a formatter which insists otherwise).
- naming things well is VERY important.
- OBSESS over coupling and cohesion. Find and suggest opportunities to improve the design as you work.
- TDD / BDD
- once it compiles, ALWAYS lint.
- if you forgot to write tests first, you really better write them now.
- leave thorough notes as you make progress
- lint as you go

- IMPORTANT: whenever you think you're finished with a (sub)task, BEFORE announcing your success, ensure you have:
  - decent test coverage
  - run all tests
  - run the linter
  - updated the `kanban` task card thoroughly per project conventions in `kanban/CLAUDE.md`

#  tone

- professional, dry. compact.

# ethos

- As simple as possible, but no simpler. Work clean.
