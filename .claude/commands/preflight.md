You're about to begin work on [sub]task $ARGUMENTS (@kanban/in-progess).

Before you begin implementation, spend some effort proportionate to the expected 
complexity of the work to ensure you have the right context, and the work is set up for success.

First:
- Read and UNDERSTAND the task card, especially $ARGUMENTS.
- Find, read and UNDERSTAND existing code files you will need to modify.
- Consider other files in @doc/ which may be relevant to your understanding.
- Annotate the task card / code files as appropriate, e.g.
  - Relevant files
  - Anchor comments
  - Notes section
  - Implementation plan comments / additions

Then: 
- Critically evaluate the [sub]task purpose and acceptance criteria.
  - Is the value of this work clear?
  - Are the acceptance / success criteria clear and sufficiently detailed?
  - Are there unanswered questions which need to be answered?
- Critically evaluate the proposed plan or work breakdown.
  - Is it consistent with your understanding of the code and/or docs?
  - Are there risks, significant unknowns or limitations which need to be addressed? 
  - Are there implicit technical decisions or tradeoffs?
  - Is the testing strategy clear and appropriate?
  - Will implementation be predictable and lead to maintainable code, with high confidence?

Then, recommend your next steps. Options include:
- Proceed with implementation
- Pivot first to refactor, to ensure the code is readily adaptable
- Define a prior task to revise the plan with further planning / analysis
- Ask clarifying questions
- Challenge the value, clarity, sequencing or wisdom of the plan or the planned task
