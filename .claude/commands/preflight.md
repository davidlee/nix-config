description: before beginning implementation: understand task, intent, and context
---
You're about to begin work on [sub]task $ARGUMENTS (@kanban/doing).

First, spend some effort *proportionate to the complexity of the work* to build
context.

You should perform just enough research to know what clarifying questions you
might need to ask the user.

Your task might be to clarify the task and produce a design doc (possibly
spending much or all of your session in research); or, having done this already
in a previous session, to write a detailed implementation plan, or to
context-efficiently execute one.

You should confirm which with the user if it is not obvious already.

Once you're situated, talk to the user about any open questions or tradeoffs,
and your readiness to complete the work. You may repeat this multiple times if
necessary, in order to drive out important decisions or risks before
implementation.

Do not begin implementation without acknowledgement from the user.
