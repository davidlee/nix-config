You're about to begin work on [sub]task $ARGUMENTS (@kanban/doing).

First, spend some effort *proportionate to the complexity of the work* to build context.

You should perform just enough research to know what clarifying questions you might need to ask the user.

Your task might be to clarify this plan (possibly spending much or all of your session in research); or, having done this already in a previous session, to context-efficiently execute it. 

You should confirm which with the user if it is not obvious already.

Once you're situated, talk to the user about any open questions or tradeoffs, and your readiness to complete the work. You may repeat this multiple times if necessary, in order to drive out important decisions or risks before implementation.

Do not begin implementation without acknowledgement from the user.
