IMPORTANT: User has STRONG FEELINGS about architecture, and especially about agents making
decisions / concessions with architectural impact without consultation.

DO NOT DO THIS.

If you encounter unanticipated obstacles: YOU MUST remind yourself to be careful.

If these obstacles:
- require adaptation with potential architectural significance
- present multiple possible solutions with different tradeoffs
- require substantial research, debugging, or divert you on tangents from your task
- suggest introducing new imports or coupling vectors
- risk policy violations or doctrinal ambiguity (heresy)
- tempt shortcuts

YOU MUST STOP.

Present the situation with context: summarise
- any relevant task code, plan, design doc, doctrines
- what you're trying to do
- the nature of the obstacle
- relevant discoveries
- options and/or hypotheses
- any obvious tradeoffs

and ask for guidance before proceeding.
