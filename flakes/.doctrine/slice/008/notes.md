# SL-008 notes

## Design triage (2026-10-16)

Evidence: `research/research.md`. Only its ✓ rows are load-bearing.

**Scope input** (user, 2026-10-16): `personal` means the machines the user
owns, so Sleipnir and Draupnir both import it and a work Mac does not. goad
on darwin is deferred to IMP-023. The Mac's lack of `~/dev` checkouts is
incidental (it is a new build).

**Constraining governance**:
- ADR-001: D2, D3, D4, D7
- ADR-002: D1, D3, D4, D5
- ADR-003
- ADR-004: D4
- ADR-005: D1, D3, D4, D6
- DEC-004, DEC-005, DEC-006, DEC-007, DEC-008, DEC-016, DEC-017, DEC-024,
  DEC-025, DEC-026, DEC-027
- POL-001
- Memories: `mem.pattern.flakes.drv-gate`, `mem.fact.nix.merge-order`,
  `mem.fact.flakes.git-add-n`, `mem.fact.flakes.fmt-relock`,
  `mem.system.flakes.home-worktree`

**Shaping decisions to make**:
- the platform-scope mechanism (QUE-001; research § Cross-thread 2,
  options a–d)
- the home base: its shape, location and layers
- how finely the Linux desktop home modules are split
- what `personal` contains, and where walker, sleipnir-doctor and alarm go
- where the ISS-008 items go
- the parked and dead modules
- the home-base coverage target and the isolation check
- the W2 boundary (eca, chatgpt)
- whether satan* gets a cross-platform `requires` on postgresql
- whether to revise ADR-002 D5 (order)
- phasing and the gate

**Risks**:
- merged-list reorders, and collision winners flipping on `home.packages`
- Linux-only halves landing silently inert on darwin, or failing inside HM
  (tailscale-systray, swayosd, mangohud, systembus-notify)
- nudge runs its `.nu` from the live checkout path, so a file move changes
  behaviour
- the drvs gate is the only check on Draupnir (no probe)
- an aarch64 home may not evaluate if `inputs.emacs` or the neovim overlay
  lacks aarch64-linux packages

**Assumptions**:
- the SL-006/007 gate carries over
- HM `c58f54c` platform behaviour as verified: systemd-only halves are inert
  on darwin
- `agents_override` is needed by every home evaluation until ISS-006 is fixed

**Open questions**: OQ-1..OQ-7 in `slice-008.md`, carried as inquiry nodes in
the design run.

## Direction from the user (2026-10-16), before the inquiring stage

- **inq-1 (QUE-001)**: a feature record may carry `platforms`, a list of
  system strings in the `meta.platforms` style (e.g. `lib.platforms.linux`,
  `["x86_64-linux"]`). Absent means every platform. The resolver gets the
  host's `system` and **refuses** a selected feature that does not support
  it. Profiles stay dumb (`mkDefault` only) and are split:
  `personal` (portable), plus `personal-linux` and `personal-darwin`, each
  of which imports `personal`. Revises ADR-002 D1/D4 and ADR-005 D6, and
  edits DEC-006.
- **inq-12 (cli)**: repartition `modules/shared/cli/_packages` by
  availability. One home list, filtered by `lib.meta.availableOn`, plus an
  explicit `brokenOn` list (watchman; atuin per ISS-007). The `isx86`
  guards go. This is a behaviour phase: Draupnir gains packages.
- Rejected: flake-parts `perSystem`/`withSystem` for module content. Those
  are per-system *outputs*; configurations already know their system
  through `pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform` (DEC-016).
- Evidence: `availableOn` on aarch64-darwin (registry nixpkgs, not the
  locked pin) is false for backintime, trashy and strace, and true for most
  of the rest of `linuxHome`. watchman claims darwin support but fails to
  build there. `meta.platforms` says what a package supports, not what
  builds or is cached.

## Taxonomy polish (user, 2026-10-16; does not block, apply in the design.md taxonomy section)

- `terminal.utils`: tmux, zmx (out of the base shell-ux bucket?) and clocks.
- text: calendars and calculators split out of `text.tools`. The emacs
  web1913 dictionary installer and sdcv may sit with aspell (a
  dictionary/spelling feature).
- `data.formats` is too broad. Hex editors, markdown pagers, and maybe a
  json/yaml split out of it.

## Harvest

fresh-as-of: design run reviewing, revision 31; head 3ac8ff5d (no SL-008 commits yet)

- **Produced**:
  - DEC-030..036 (accepted; each shapes SL-008);
  - QUE-001 answered (DEC-030);
  - IMP-023 (goad on darwin);
  - `design.md` materialised at revision 31;
  - RV-017 (design review ledger, auto-opened, 0 findings).
- **Learned**: these are facts for this slice. Promote them to memories at close.
  - HM `c58f54c`: `systemd.user.enable` defaults to isLinux, and the platform
    assertion sits under `mkIf`. So systemd-only halves are inert on darwin,
    while tailscale-systray, systembus-notify, swayosd and mangohud fail.
  - Area files are plain lists without `lib`.
  - `bin/spotify-alarm` calls `spotify_player` from PATH.
  - nudge runs `.nu` from the live checkout path.
- **Open (to resolve at close)**:
  - IMP-016 → resolved by DEC-032.
  - ISS-008 → fixed in P3.
  - REVs on ADR-002 (D1, D4, D5) and ADR-005 D6, plus the DEC-006 edit:
    raise before P1.
- **Uncommitted**: everything under `.doctrine/slice/008/`, DEC-030..036,
  IMP-023 and the QUE-001 settle. Commit with the design lock (or before
  review, if the user wants).
- **Other untracked items, not SL-008's**: IDE-003..005, IMP-020/021 and
  ISS-009. Leave them alone.
